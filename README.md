Soooooo... It is april first and i was going through reddit when i saw a few posts about this april fools idea. The idea was to get everyone to google search "bing" and make it the most searched thing on google trends for the day. I always had sympathy for bing being a very unpopular search engine, so I did my part and wrote this short script to automate the action of google searching bing...then I looped it...a few times...10000 times...
